India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the
Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate. India’s defin-
ing geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian
Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a
north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and
later, south and south-east. Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic
crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.These
dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth’s mantle, both cre-
ated the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust even-
tually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.Immediately
south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough
that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment and now constitutes the
Indo-Gangetic Plain. Cut off from the plain by the ancient Aravalli
Range lies the Thar Desert.
