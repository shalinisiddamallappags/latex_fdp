By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian
subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved. The earli-
est known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000
years ago.After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops
and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agri-
cultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now
Balochistan.These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civili-
sation,the first urban culture in South Asia, which flourished during
2500â€“1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India.India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the Indo-Australian Plate. India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east. Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[161] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Cut off from the plain by the ancient Aravalli Range lies the Thar Desert.
